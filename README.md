# Real-Time Machine Learning Intrusion Detection for Telnet Attacks
Telnet is a legacy remote access protocol that transmits data in plaintext, making it highly vulnerable to multiple types of attacks such as brute-force login attempts and unauthorized access. Due to the lack of encryption and authentication mechanisms, attackers can easily exploit Telnet services to gain access to target systems. In this project, a Telnet-based attack scenario was implemented to simulate realistic network intrusions. Network traffic generated during both normal and malicious Telnet sessions was captured and analyzed. Machine Learning models were then trained to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic, forming a lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
